Under a high development scenario, industrial water demand in the Peace River watershed is projected to increase by over 350{\%} by 2030, and future water security in the context of the water-energy nexus is unknown, especially with continued climate warming. In this study, hydrological models are used to simulate the current and future water balance for two headwater catchments of the Peace River watershed, one in the foothills and one in the plains. Both catchments have been impacted by the recent shale gas development, and both contain oil and gas industry water use permits. Climate variables output from three Global Climate Models were used as inputs for the hydrologic models. Water quantity projections for future decades (2020s, 2030s, 2040s, and 2050s) were then compared to the projected water use for low, medium, and high shale gas development scenarios and used to estimate the potential for water scarcity in the region. Results from this study show that areas with high levels of oil and gas industry development may experience water scarcity if rapid industrial growth continues, and improved water management policies will be needed to mitigate the high industrial water demand.},

abstract="A number of statistical downscaling methodologies have been introduced to bridge the gap in scale between outputs of climate models and climate information needed to assess potential impacts at local and regional scales. Four statistical downscaling methods [bias-correction/spatial disaggregation (BCSD), bias-correction/constructed analogue (BCCA), multivariate adaptive constructed analogs (MACA), and bias-correction/climate imprint (BCCI)] are applied to downscale the latest climate forecast system reanalysis (CFSR) data to stations for precipitation, maximum temperature, and minimum temperature over South Korea. All methods are calibrated with observational station data for 19Ã‚Â years from 1973 to 1991 and validated for the more recent 19-year period from 1992 to 2010. We construct a comprehensive suite of performance metrics to inter-compare methods, which is comprised of five criteria related to time-series, distribution, multi-day persistence, extremes, and spatial structure. Based on the performance metrics, we employ technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) and apply 10,000 different weighting combinations to the criteria of performance metrics to identify a robust statistical downscaling method and important criteria. The results show that MACA and BCSD have comparable skill in the time-series related criterion and BCSD outperforms other methods in distribution and extremes related criteria. In addition, MACA and BCCA, which incorporate spatial patterns, show higher skill in the multi-day persistence criterion for temperature, while BCSD shows the highest skill for precipitation. For the spatial structure related criterion, BCCA and MACA outperformed BCSD and BCCI. From the TOPSIS analysis, we found that MACA is the most robust method for all variables in South Korea, and BCCA and BCSD are the second for temperature and precipitation, respectively. We also found that the contribution of the multi-day persistence and spatial structure related criteria are crucial to ranking the skill of statistical downscaling methods.",

abstract="An electricity generation planning framework incorporating adaptation to hydro-climatic change is presented. The planning framework internalizes risks and opportunities associated with alternative hydro-climate scenarios to identify a long-term system configuration robust to uncertainty. The implications of a robust response to hydro-climatic change are demonstrated for the electricity system in British Columbia (BC), Canada. Adaptation strategy is crucial in this region, mainly due to the large contribution of hydropower resources to regional electricity supply. Analysis of results from basin-scale hydrologic models driven with downscaled global climate data suggest that shifts in regional streamflow characteristics by the year 2050 are likely to increase BC's annual hydropower potential by more than 10 {\%}. These effects combined with an estimated decrease in electricity demand by 2 {\%} due to warmer temperatures, could provide an additional 11 TWh of annual energy. Uncertainties in these projected climate impacts indicate technology configurations offering significant long-term operational flexibility will be needed to ensure system reliability. Results from the regional long-term electricity generation model incorporating adaptive capacity show the significant shifts required in the non-hydro capacity mix to ensure system robustness cause an increase in cumulative operating costs of between 1 and 7 {\%}. Analysis of technology configurations involving high-penetrations of wind generation highlights interactions between flexibility requirements occurring over multiple temporal scales.",

journal="Water Resources Management",
year="2014",
month="Jan",
day="01",
volume="28",
number="1",
pages="15--40",
abstract="The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) is a well-established drought index that is based on transforming the interannual distribution of precipitation to a standard normal distribution. Because of its robust statistical basis, SPI is readily applicable to different regions making comparisons between locations and time windows possible. Nevertheless, the usability of SPI results is undermined by shortcomings that are partly resultant from data and model uncertainties. One such shortcoming is the inability of the existing SPI model to include change in variability of interannual precipitation from non-stationary normal -- mostly caused by climate change. In addition, epistemic uncertainty in the form of incompleteness in station-wide precipitation records results in heterogeneity and inconsistency in SPI results. The effects of such epistemic uncertainty on the accuracy of estimations of long-term changes in drought frequency are mostly unknown. Given such deficiency, SPI's procedure and subsequent results remain deterministic and inadequately informative. Here, we introduce modifications to the traditional SPI using Dempster-Shafer theory (DST) to enable modeling and propagation of variability and epistemic uncertainty with the regular SPI procedure. By generalizing the SPI model from a deterministic setting to an ``uncertainty-driven setting'' provided by DST, this work makes possible: (a) efficiently propagating data uncertainty in interpolation of station-wide precipitation and SPI, and (b) modeling the effects of shift in precipitation normals (due to e.g., climate change) on drought frequency. In addition, the significance of this shift may then be evaluated with respect to the epistemic uncertainty by measuring how much of the surrounding epistemic uncertainty this shift encloses (i.e., ``probability of enclosing''). The latter is especially important due to large unknowns already associated with climate change modeling. We implement the model on summer extreme drought for the Okanagan Basin, BC, Canada. For a single general circulation model and scenario (CGCM3 A2) a maximum 7 {\%} increase in summer extreme drought (for 2080s, as per current definition) is estimated with a maximum probability of enclosing of 36 {\%}.",

Using GPS collars with dual-axis motion sensors that recorded the number of switches every 5 minutes we tested the hypotheses: 1. Grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) increase daily activity levels and active bout lengths when they forage on berries, the major high-energy food in this ecosystem, and 2. Grizzly bears become less active and more nocturnal when ambient temperature exceeds 20Ã‚Â°C. We found support for hypothesis 1 with both male and female bears being active from 0.7 to 2.8 h longer in the berry season than in other seasons. Our prediction under hypothesis 2 was not supported. When bears foraged on berries on a dry, open mountainside, there was no relationship between daily maximum temperature (which varied from 20.4 to 40.1Ã‚Â°C) and the total amount of time bears were active, and no difference in activity levels during day or night between warm (20.4Ã¢Â€Â“27.3Ã‚Â°C) and hot (27.9Ã¢Â€Â“40.1Ã‚Â°C) days. Our results highlight the strong influence that food acquisition has on activity levels and patterns of grizzly bears and is a challenge to the heat dissipation limitation theory.},

The uncertainty of annual streamflow, hydrograph, flow duration curve (FDC), and flood frequency were evaluated. The results reveal that the annual streamflows of the Beaver and Pefferlaw River Basins (PRB) are projected to slightly increase in 2020Ã¢Â€Â“2099 while the annual streamflows of the East Holland River Basin (EHRB) are expected to be similar in 2020Ã¢Â€Â“2099.

abstract={Wetlands play an important role in preventing extreme low flows in rivers and groundwater level drawdowns during drought periods. This hydrological function could become increasingly important under a warmer climate. Links between peatlands, aquifers, and rivers remain inadequately understood. The objective of this study was to evaluate the hydrologic functions of the Lanoraie peatland complex in southern Quebec, Canada, under different climate conditions. This peatland complex has developed in the beds of former fluvial channels during the final stages of the last deglaciation. The peatland covers a surface area of ~76 km2 and feeds five rivers. Numerical simulations were performed using a steady-state groundwater flow model. Results show that the peatland contributes on average to 77% of the mean annual river base flow. The peatland receives 52% of its water from the aquifer. Reduced recharge scenarios (Ã¢ÂˆÂ’20 and Ã¢ÂˆÂ’50% of current conditions) were used as a surrogate of climate change. With these scenarios, the simulated mean head decreases by 0.6 and 1.6 m in the sand. The mean river base flow decreases by 16 and 41% with the two scenarios. These results strongly underline the importance of aquifer-peatland-river interactions at the regional scale. They also point to the necessity of considering the entire hydrosystem in conservation initiatives.},

  abstract = {This study evaluates regional-scale projections of climate indices that are relevant to climate change impacts in Canada. We consider indices of relevance to different sectors including those that describe heat conditions for different crop types, temperature threshold exceedances relevant for human beings and ecological ecosystems such as the number of days temperatures are above certain thresholds, utility relevant indices that indicate levels of energy demand for cooling or heating, and indices that represent precipitation conditions. Results are based on an ensemble of high-resolution statistically downscaled climate change projections from 24 global climate models (GCMs) under the RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 emissions scenarios. The statistical downscaling approach includes a bias-correction procedure, resulting in more realistic indices than those computed from the original GCM data. We find that the level of projected changes in the indices scales well with the projected increase in the global mean temperature and is insensitive to the emission scenarios. At the global warming level about 2.1Â {\textdegree}C above pre-industrial (corresponding to the multi-model ensemble mean for 2031--2050 under the RCP8.5 scenario), there is almost complete model agreement on the sign of projected changes in temperature indices for every region in Canada. This includes projected increases in extreme high temperatures and cooling demand, growing season length, and decrease in heating demand. Models project much larger changes in temperature indices at the higher 4.5Â {\textdegree}C global warming level (corresponding to 2081--2100 under the RCP8.5 scenario). Models also project an increase in total precipitation, in the frequency and intensity of precipitation, and in extreme precipitation. Uncertainty is high in precipitation projections, with the result that models do not fully agree on the sign of changes in most regions even at the 4.5Â {\textdegree}C global warming level.},

  abstract = {The global climate is changing and altering the hydrologic cycle that results in (i) reduction of water supply; (ii) increase in frequency and magnitude of flood and drought events; (iii) damage to the shoreline areas; (iv) increase in irrigation water use; (v) decrease in quality of all freshwater sources; and (vi) increase in functional and operational requirements for the existing water infrastructure. The paper provides the review of water resources management challenges posed by the climate change. In order to provide guidance for including climate change impacts into water management studies, a generic approach is detailed for potential implementation in practice. Methods for selecting global climate models and emission scenarios, followed by bias correction and downscaling are discussed. The paper ends with the description of one practical example, IDF{\_}CC, a web based tool for updating intensity duration frequency curves under changing climate. The tool is designed in response to real needs of water engineering practice and has been in use in Canada since early 2015.},

  abstract = {This study investigates the relationship between historically observed changes in extreme precipitation magnitudes and temperature (Pex-T relationship) at multiple locations in Canada. The focus is on understanding the behavior of these relationships with regards to key storm characteristics such as its duration, season of occurrence, and location. To do so, three locations are chosen such that they have large amounts of moisture available near them whereas four locations are chosen such that they are located in the land-locked regions of Canada and subsequently have no nearby moisture source available on them. To investigate the effect of different storm durations on Pex-T relationship, storms of durations: 5, 10, 15, 30Â min, 1, 2, 6, 12, 24Â h are considered. Finally, Pex-T relationship is analyzed separately for summer and winter seasons to quantify the influence of seasons. Results indicate strong influences of storm duration, season of occurrence, and location on observed precipitation scaling rates. Drastic intensification of precipitation extremes with temperature is obtained for shorter duration precipitation events than for longer duration precipitation events, in summers than in the winters. Furthermore, in summertime, increases in the intensity of convection driven precipitation extremes is found highest at locations away from large waterbodies. On the other hand, in wintertime most drastic increases in extreme precipitation are obtained at locations near large waterbodies. These findings contribute towards increasing the current understanding of precipitation extremes in the context of rapidly increasing global temperatures.},

  abstract  = {Abstract Future sediment dynamics may be affected by changing climates or hydrological regimes because of the close link between hydrology and sediment erosion, deposition, and transport. Previously, investigations of these potential changes have been constrained by a combination of limited observational data, hydrological drivers, and appropriate mechanistic models. Additionally, there is often ambiguity regarding how to disentangle the impacts of climate and hydrology from direct human factors such as reservoirs and land-use change, which often exert more control over sediment dynamics. In this study, we utilize a recently developed, large-scale, distributed, mechanistic sediment transport model to project future sediment erosion, deposition, and transportation within the Fraser River Basin in British Columbia, CanadaÃ¢Â€Â”a basin with historical water flux and sediment load observations and limited anthropogenic influences upstream of its delta. The sediment model is driven by synthetic land-surface hydrology derived from Scenarios A1B, A2, and B1 of the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios, which were provided by the Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium. Resulting simulations of water flux and sediment load from 1965 to 1994 are first validated against observational data then compared with future projections. Future projections show an overall increase in annual hillslope erosion and in-channel transportation, a shift towards earlier spring peak erosion and transportation, and longer persistence of the sediment signal through the year. These shifts in timing and annual yield may have deleterious effects on spawning sockeye salmon and are insufficient to counteract future coastal retreat caused by sea-level rise.},

  abstract  = {{Evaluation of downscaled meteorological information is crucial to identifying model behaviors that may propagate to end applications such as the simulation of local air quality. This study conducted and assessed yearlong simulations of hourly meteorological conditions over the TerraceÃ¢Â€Â“Kitimat Valley of northwestern British Columbia, Canada, at 1-km horizontal gridding for six PBL schemes in the Weather and Forecasting (WRF) Model, version 4.0. In terms of key surface meteorological variables that affect air quality, simulations over land demonstrated better skill for specific humidity and wind direction than for air temperature and wind speed. Spatial differences in modeled atmospheric properties and vertical profiles, especially for moisture content, were used to diagnose the relative capacity of each PBL scheme to represent pollutant dispersion and dilution. Stable conditions at night increased suppression of boundary layer mixing by the nonlocal Yonsei University (YSU) scheme when compared with suppression by the local eddy-diffusion component of the Asymmetric Convective Model, version 2 (ACM2), scheme, resulting in decreased wind speed and ambient temperature but moister air with the YSU scheme. The weakening of mixing by the MellorÃ¢Â€Â“YamadaÃ¢Â€Â“NakanishiÃ¢Â€Â“Niino (MYNN3) scheme with inland distance suggested that higher-order, nonlocal transport is sensitive to increasing topographic steepness toward the northern part of the valley. Disparities in mixing strengths among PBL schemes were greater in the summer when conditions were generally less stable with moist, warm air blowing inland than in winter when the valley channels cold, stable air from the interior. Increased convection in daytime led to greater entrainment of air from aloft and a thicker PBL with the YSU scheme than with the ACM2 scheme in summer while increasing countergradient transport in the MYNN3 scheme that reduces dilution.}},
